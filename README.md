The code for the book "Simple Serverles Architectures"

## Why this book exists

I had many lively experiences with engineers in my years managing engineering teams where complexity and persistence to beloved technologies with no merit have been argued passionately. 

Serverless technologies bring a paradigm shift into modern software engineering, and they can empower even less experienced engineers and help them build scalable, fault tolerant and resilient applications. At the same time these characteristics can be achieved while code and architectural simplicity is achieved. 

Given also the option to use Python, which is a very friendly and powerful language that can cover most aspects of the development cycle. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide every necessary building block, with seamless interoperability, scalability and extremely low cost.

This document is the distillation of these discussions and ideas and it aims to help you design and build serverless applications with Python that will cover most development needs. 

We will build a fully-fledged application during this book

I hope you will enjoy it and will provide you with a fresh perspective!
